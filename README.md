# VISTA-FISH
Contains all scripts for processing datasets from the VISTA-FISH protocol, as stated in the paper.

Scripts are grouped by datasets and functions. SMAD+GCAMP contains all preprocessing, clustering, Calcium imaging, RNA velocity, and other analysis that was conducted on the SMAD neuron dataset. 

Brightfield-segmentation contains all scripts and instructions pertaining to the segmentations conducted with Cellpose and Cellprofiler on the perturbed iNeurons. 

The iNeuron+Lysosome folder contains code that generated all of the data and figures in Figure 6 of the paper such as the lysosome tracking and morphologies, along with the preprocessing and clustering of the perturbed iNeuron dataset.
